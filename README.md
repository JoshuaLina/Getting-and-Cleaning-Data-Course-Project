# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
# The purpose of this project is to demostrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
# The dataset is provided by the "Human Activity Recongnition Using Smartphone Dataset" study, by Reyest[Ortiz et al.

# This dataset comprise data from 30 volunteers between 19-48 years of age who performd a six activities when whearing a smatphone (Sansum Galaxy S II) on the weist
#### activity 1: Wlaking
#### activity 2: Walking_Upstairs
#### activity 3: Wlaking_Dowstairs
#### activity 4: Sitting
#### activity 5: Standing
#### activity 6: Laying
        
## during this activities the researched captured 3-axial linear aceleration and 3-axial angular velovity at a 50Hz sample frequency

# The target is to provide a tidy data set
# I used Rstudio Version 0.98.1103 â€“ in Windows 7, 64 bits operation System.
        
        # The first step i did was:Unzip the data set in a specific forlde calld " finalproject"
        # Read all data  to Rstudio using the read.table function (read.table())
              # the data variables were:
                    # y_test.txt
                    # x_test.txt
                    # x_traint.txt
                    # y_train.txt
                    # subject_train.txt, subject_test.txt
        # The procedure to optain the tidy data from this dataset is clearly indicated in the R-scrip
